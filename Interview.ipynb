A dictionary in Python is a collection of elements that are stored as key-value pairs. It is an unordered data structure, and the indexing is done based on the keys assigned to each element. Let’s consider an example: we have a dictionary named ‘dict’ with two keys, ‘Country’ and ‘Capital’, which have corresponding values ‘India’ and ‘New Delhi’, respectively.\n#       Syntax :\ndict={'Country':'India','Capital':'New Delhi' }\nprint(dict)\n#       Output :  Country: India, Capital: New Delhi",

This method can also be utilized to set initial values for variables.\n#      eg: \nclass Human:\n    def __init__(self, age):\n        self.age = age\n    def say(self):\n        print('Hello, my age is', self.age)\nh = Human(22)\nh.say()\n# Output : Hello, my age is 22",

This makes generators memory efficient as they don’t generate the entire sequence of values upfront but rather generate values on-demand.\n\n#       Generators are helpful when dealing with large datasets or when the complete sequence of values is not needed at once.
